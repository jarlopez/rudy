Rudy - a small web server 
=========================
**Write your own web server and access it using a regular web browser**

In this assignment you will build a small web server; sounds more complicate than it is. Before the seminar you should have started with Erlang and have completed a small web server. You should have done some performance measurements and written a small report describing your experiments and findings.

* [RFC 2616](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt)A

You should complete the rudimentary server described above and do some
experiments. Set up the server on one machine and access it from another machine. A small benchmark program can generate requests and measure the time it takes to receive the answers. Write up your findings in a small report.

During the seminar we will discuss your findings and discuss pros and cons on how to improve the server.
